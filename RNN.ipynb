The most pathetic scenes were those when the Columbian rebels were making their cases for revolutions. Maria Conchita Alonso appeared phony, and her pseudo-love affair with Walken was nothing but a pathetic emotional plug in a movie that was devoid of any real meaning.

    "• RNN processes sequence input by iterating through the elements. RNNs pass the outputs from one timestep to their input on the next timestep.\n",

    "• A bidirectional wrapper can also be used with an RNN layer. This layer propagates the input forward and backward through the RNN layer and then concatenates the final output.\n",

    "• The main advantage of a bidirectional RNN is that the signal from the beginning of the input doesn't need to be processed through every timestep to affect the output.\n",
